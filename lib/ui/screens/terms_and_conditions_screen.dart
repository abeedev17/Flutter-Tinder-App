Rooming Safety TipsMeeting new people is exciting, but you should always be cautious when interacting with someone you don’t know. Use your best judgment and put yoursafety first, whether you are exchanging initial messages or meeting in person.While you can’t control the actions of others, there are things you can do to helpyou stay safe during your GAR experience.Online Safety● Never Send Money or Share Financial Information Prior to theRooming periodNever send money, especially over wire transfer, even if the person claimsto be in an emergency. Wiring money is like sending cash — it’s nearlyimpossible to reverse the transaction or trace where the money went.Never share information that could be used to access your financialaccounts. If another user asks you for money, report it to us immediately.For tips on avoiding romance scams, check out some advice from the U.SFederal Trade Commission on the FTC website.● Protect Your Personal InformationNever share personal information, such as your social security number,home or work address, or details about your daily routine (e.g., that you goto a certain gym every Monday) with people you don’t know. If you are aparent, limit the information that you share about your children on yourprofile and in early communications. Avoid sharing details such as yourchildren’s names, where they go to school, or their ages or genders.● Stay on the PlatformKeep conversations on the GAR platform while you’re getting to knowsomeone. Because exchanges on GAR are subject to our Safe Message
Filters (learn more here), users with bad intentions often try to move the conversation to text, messaging apps, email, or phone right away.● Report All Suspicious and Offensive BehaviorYou know when someone’s crossed the line and when they do, we want toknow about it. Block and report anyone that violates our terms. Here aresome examples of violations:○ Requests for donations○ Underage users○ Harassment, threats, and offensive messages○ Inappropriate or harmful behavior during or after meeting in person○ Fraudulent profiles○ Spam or solicitation including links to commercial websites orattempts to sell products or services● You can report any concerns about suspicious behavior from any profilepage or messaging window here. For more information, check out ourCommunity Guidelines.● Protect Your AccountBe sure to pick a strong password, and always be careful when logginginto your account from a public or shared computer. GAR will never sendyou an email asking for your username and password information — if youreceive an email asking for account information, report it immediately.Meeting in Person● Don’t Be In A RushTake your time and get to know the other person before agreeing to meetor chat off GAR. Don’t be afraid to ask questions to screen for any redflags or personal dealbreakers. A phone or video call can be a usefulscreening tool before meeting. (We very highly recommend calling with theperson you’re going to room with ahead of time)
● Tell Friends and Family About Your PlansTell a friend or family member of your plans, including when and whereyou’re going. Have your cell phone charged and with you at all times.● Know Your LimitsBe aware of the effects of drugs or alcohol on you specifically — they canimpair your judgment and your alertness. If your date tries to pressure youto use drugs or drink more than you’re comfortable with, hold your ground.● Don’t Leave Drinks or Personal Items UnattendedKnow where your drink comes from and know where it is at all times —only accept drinks poured or served directly from room service or theminibar. Many substances that are slipped into drinks to facilitate sexualassault are odorless, colorless, and tasteless. Also, keep your phone,purse, wallet, and anything containing personal information on you at alltimes.Sexual Health & Consent● Protect YourselfWhen used correctly and consistently, condoms can significantly reducethe risk of contracting and passing on STI’s like HIV. But, be aware of STIslike herpes or HPV that can be passed on through skin-to-skin contact. Therisk of contracting some STIs can be reduced through vaccination.● Know Your StatusNot all STIs show symptoms, and you don’t want to be in the dark aboutyour status. Stay on top of your health and prevent the spread of STIs bygetting tested regularly. Here’s where you can find a clinic near you (USonly).● Talk About ItCommunication is everything: Before you get physically intimate with apartner, talk about sexual health and STI testing. And be aware — in some
places, it’s actually a crime to knowingly pass on an STI. Need help starting the conversation? Here are some tips.● ConsentAll sexual activity must start with consent and should include ongoingcheck-ins with your partner. Verbal communication can help you and yourpartner ensure that you respect each other’s boundaries. Consent can bewithdrawn at any time, and sex is never owed to anyone. Do not proceed ifyour partner seems uncomfortable or unsure, or if your partner is unable toconsent due to the effects of drugs or alcohol. Read more about it here.Resources for Help, Support, or AdviceRemember — even if you follow these tips, no method of risk reduction is perfect.If you have a negative experience, please know that it is not your fault and help isavailable. Report any incidents GAR, and consider reaching out to one of theresources below. If you feel you are in immediate danger or need emergencyassistance, call 999 (Hong Kong) or your local law enforcement agency.1. Overview. Arbitration is an alternative to litigation where a neutral person(the "Arbitrator") hears and decides the parties’ dispute. Arbitrationproceedings are designed to provide parties with a fair hearing in a mannerthat is faster and less formal than court proceedings. The followingprocedures (the “Arbitration Procedures”) are applicable to all arbitrationproceedings involving you and GAR.2. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution. GAR is always interested in resolvingdisputes amicably and efficiently. So before you commence an arbitration,we suggest that you contact us to explain your complaint, as we may be
able to resolve it without the need for arbitration. You may contact us atCustomer Support.3. Administrator. The administrator for the arbitration is JAMS, anorganization that is not affiliated with GAR. The JAMS facilitates, but doesnot itself conduct, the arbitration. The arbitrator who will hear and decideyour dispute will be chosen from the JAMS's roster of neutral arbitrators.For information on the JAMS, please visit its website,https://www.jamsadr.com. Information about JAMS's rules and fees forresolving disputes can be found at JAMS’s Streamlined Arbitration Rules &Procedures page, https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/.4. Applicable Rules. The arbitration will be governed by JAMS’s StreamlinedArbitration Rules & Procedures (the JAMS Rules”), as modified by theseArbitration Procedures. If there is any inconsistency between the JAMSRules and these Arbitration Procedures, the Arbitration Procedures willcontrol. However, if the Arbitrator determines that strict application of anyterm of the Arbitration Procedures would result in a fundamentally unfairarbitration (the "Unfair Term"), then the Arbitrator shall have authority tomodify the Unfair Term to the extent necessary to ensure a fundamentallyfair arbitration that is consistent with these Arbitration Procedures (the“Modified Term”). In determining the substance of a Modified Term, theArbitrator shall select a term that comes closest to expressing the intentionof the Unfair Term.5. Commencing an Arbitration. To commence an arbitration against GAR, youmust complete a short form, submit it to JAMS, and send a copy to ourcustomer support email. To learn more about commencing an arbitrationand to obtain a form to institute arbitration, please visit the JAMS websiteand download the form available at,https://www.jamsadr.com/files/Uploads/Documents/JAMS_Arbitration_Demand.pdf. You may represent yourself in the arbitration or have a lawyer (or
some other representative) act on your behalf. Upon receipt of anarbitration claim, GAR may assert any counterclaims it may have againstthe complaining party.6. Fees. You are responsible for paying all of the fees set forth in the JAMSfee schedule for consumer disputes. except to the extent that fees paid byeither party may be re-allocated upon order of the Arbitrator following adetermination (a) that other party’s claim or counterclaim was filed forpurposes of harassment or was frivolous, (b) that the other party engagedin any activities during the course of the arbitration for the purposes ofharassment or to cause unnecessary costs or delay, or (c) thatre-allocation is permitted by applicable law. If your claim against GAR is forless than 1,000 USD and you succeed on the merits, we will pay all fees,subject to the potential re-allocation discussed in the prior sentence. If youbelieve you cannot afford the JAMS fee, you may apply to JAMS for a feewaiver.7. Discovery. Each party may (a) request relevant, non-privileged documentsfrom the other party; and (b) request that the other party provide theparticulars of its claims or responses to no more than 5 relevantinterrogatories (including subparts). Any such discovery requests must beserved on the other party within 10 days after the Arbitrator’s appointment.The responding party shall provide the requesting party with all responsive,non-privileged documents, responses to the requested interrogatories,and/or any objections to the requests within 30 days after receipt of therequests. In the event of an objection to any discovery request, theobjecting party shall not be required to provide any documents orinterrogatory responses within the scope of the objection until the later of(a) 30 days after the Arbitrator resolves the dispute or (b) a deadline forproduction determined by the Arbitrator. In the event either party requeststhat the Arbitrator consider a dispositive motion prior to the expiration of a
response deadline set forth in this paragraph, such response deadlineshall be extended until 30 days following (a) the Arbitrator’s decision on therequest to hear the dispositive motion or (b) if the Arbitrator grants therequest to hear the dispositive motion, the Arbitrator’s final decision onsuch dispositive motion. Depositions shall not be permitted, unless agreedto by both parties. Any disputes about discovery or requests for extensionsshall be submitted promptly to the Arbitrator for prompt resolution. In rulingon any discovery dispute or extension request, the Arbitrator shall take intoconsideration the nature, amount, and scope of the underlying arbitrationclaim, the cost and other effort that would be involved in providing therequested discovery, the case schedule, and whether the requesteddiscovery is necessary for the adequate preparation of a claim or defense.8. Communications with the Arbitrator. Whenever communicating with theArbitrator, the parties must include each other – for example, by includingthe other party on a telephone conference call and copying the other partyon any written submissions, such as letters or emails. To the extentpracticable, conferences with the Arbitrator will take place by telephoneconference call or email. Ex parte communications are not permitted withthe Arbitrator.9. Confidentiality. Upon either party’s request, the Arbitrator will issue anorder requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed duringthe arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used ordisclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding toenforce the arbitration award and that any permitted filing of confidentialinformation must be done under seal.10. Arbitration Hearing. The Parties agree to waive an oral hearing andsubmit the dispute to the Arbitrator for an Award based on writtensubmissions and other evidence as the Parties may agree, unless a partyrequests an oral Hearing in writing within 10 days after the Arbitrator’s
appointment. The Parties agree that the Arbitrator shall have the authorityto consider dispositive motions without an oral evidentiary hearing if itdetermines that the motion is likely to succeed and will dispose of ornarrow the issues in the case.
